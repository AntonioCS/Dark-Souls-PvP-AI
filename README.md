TODO:  
  [bug priority] subanimation detection for dodge isnt working, AttackSubanimationActive is too soon before hurtbox.  

  [high priority] neural network training, test implementation in main program.  
  [high priority] sometimes double rolling. issue with subanimation detection?  
  [high priority] If broken out of dodge animation, instead of exiting roll i double roll. fix.   
  [high priority] verify ghost hit works  

  [medium priority] get dynamic angle change while rolling to roll bs.  
  [medium priority]	Stamia management  
  [medium priority, can just not invade for now]	Pointers have to be reread for characters because end address changes when invading  
  [medium priority, use CE for now]	Must lock camera(x and y pos and rotation), rotation x set to PI. or 0. It changed?  

  [low priority, currently sub-millisecond]	ReadPlayer should read memory in chunks, not individual calls to ReadMemory  
  [low priority]	Find range of weapons(hitbox size,bows,etc)  
  [low priority]	Better Vjoy loading/unloading    
  [low priority, use FANN only for now]		Have a build flag which determines if the program uses my handwritten neural netowrk or someone elses library neural network
