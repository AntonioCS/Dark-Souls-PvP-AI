People who if you like this you should also follow:  
https://github.com/eur0pa. Creator of dark souls pvp watchdog. Thanks man!  
https://github.com/OrdinaryMagician. Various projects in dark souls 2, and assembly master.   
https://www.youtube.com/user/Birdulon. Master reverse engineerer, seriously he found the Dark Souls 2 bullet params a week after it came out.  
  
-reverse engineer dark souls plantom player pointer and struct  
-code to read darksouls.exe's memory   
-send joystick commands  
-ai logic to play  
  
Setup:  
Vjoy controller device config:  
	x,y,z,rx,ry,15 buttons,1 discrete pov  

## Neural Networks:  
Defense Network Inputs:  
  -Player Distance from Enemy  
  -The angle the enemy is off from directly in front of the player  
  -The enemy velocity  
  -The rotation difference between the enemy and the player  

//TODO what inputs should i give to teach attack neural net?  
Attack Network Inputs:  
  -Player distance from Enemy(also send as non-ranged)  
  -Player stamina (not used as input, just post check)(enemy stamina not sent over wire)  


## TODO: 
  attack id not found  
  744301,253301,485102(r weapon 309005, moonlight gs),  
  754301 (flamberg 2 hand)

  turning away during some attacks
  kicking instead of attacking

  [high] use more than 1 attack types, dynamic range for weapon attacks  
  [high] too prone to trading
  [high] hurtbox for enemy not working on jumping attacks
  [high] toggle escaping(cant dodge everything always, lag)
  [high] get dynamic weapon range working
  [high priority] make this strafe in the same direction as the enemy strafe  
  [high priority] try to bs with neural network on and using strafing, train with that   
  [high priority] teach poise  

  [high priority] fix ghost hit  

  [medium priority] get dynamic angle change while rolling to roll bs.  
  [medium priority, can just not invade for now]	Pointers have to be reread for characters because end address changes when invading  
  [medium priority, use CE for now]	Must lock camera(x and y pos and rotation), rotation x set to PI or 0 depending on map.

  [low priority, currently sub-millisecond]	ReadPlayer should read memory in chunks, not individual calls to ReadMemory  
  [low priority]	Find range of weapons(hitbox size,bows,etc)  
  [low priority]	Stamia management(for dodge, attack handled)  
  [low priority]	Better Vjoy loading/unloading    
  [low priority, use FANN only for now]		Have a build flag which determines if the program uses my handwritten neural netowrk or someone elses library neural network  
  [low] fix camera to keep it locked for entire fight. y still messing up(not y, pitch or yaw?)

  [cannot fix] lag will sometimes made perfect dodges impossible b/c hurtbox will appear before the windup animation finishes  
  [cannot fix] If broken out of dodge animation, instead of exiting roll i double roll due to queued animation system.
