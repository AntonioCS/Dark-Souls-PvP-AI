/*determine what type of action the animation id is.

i cant seem to find a pattern in the ids, so this is just a big switch statement

ranged attacks use a different format: they have a specific animation for windup,recover, and hurtbox creation; while others rely on a subanimation id to determine windup, hurtbox, and recovery.
because of this, have to specify if we need to look at subanimation
0 is not attack animation, 1 is hurtbox is created, 2 is attack id but must check subanimation

NOTE: a lookup array would probably be faster, but by VERY little*/
